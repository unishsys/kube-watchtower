**Kube-Watchtower README**

## Introduction:

The Kube-Watchtower is a Kubernetes-based project designed to provide a centralized monitoring and management platform for cluster resources and deployments. This repository contains the source code for the Kube-Watchtower server-side application, written in Go.

## Features:

### Core Features

- Real-time monitoring of Kubernetes cluster resources (namespaces, pods, deployments, services)
- ConfigMap management (create, update, get)
- Deployment management (scale, list, get YAML files)
- Service creation and deletion
- Pod log retrieval
- Cluster logging and alerting

### Additional Functionality

- CORS support for cross-origin requests
- Ping endpoint for health checks
- Static file serving for assets and spa files

## Architecture:

The Kube-Watchtower application consists of the following components:

1. **Handler**: The core logic handler responsible for processing incoming requests.
2. **KubeClient**: A wrapper around the Kubernetes API client, used to interact with the cluster.
3. **Echo Server**: An HTTP server implementation based on the LabStack Echo framework.

## Usage:

### Running the Application

To run the Kube-Watchtower application, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go run main.go
```

The application will start and listen for incoming requests on port 8081.
